# Album Covers
A repository for high-quality album covers


## Why?
There are many amazing album covers, mainly from the analog era, that did not get the digital transfer they deserved.

## Example
Here is the before/after of the restoration of an album cover ([Esbee Family - [1980] Chics and Chicken](https://github.com/hmerritt/album-covers/tree/master/covers/Esbee%20Family/%5B1980%5D%20Chics%20and%20Chicken))
